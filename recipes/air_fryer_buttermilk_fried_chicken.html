        <p>Buttermilk fried chicken in the air fryer... Delicious fried chicken without the fry!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken thighs in a shallow casserole dish. Pour buttermilk over chicken <br>and refrigerate for 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix flour, seasoned salt, and pepper in a large gallon-sized resealable plastic <br>bag. Dredge chicken thighs in seasoned flour. Dip back into buttermilk, then <br>coat with panko bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Spray the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange 1/2 of the <br>chicken thighs in the basket, making sure none are touching. Spray top of each <br>chicken thigh with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes. Flip the thighs and spray tops of <br>chicken again. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices <br>run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into <br>the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Repeat with <br>remaining chicken.</li>
        </ol>
